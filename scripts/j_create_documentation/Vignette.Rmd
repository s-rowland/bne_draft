# Overview
## BNE Overview 
 Bayesian Non-parametric Ensemble (BNE) is an ensemble approach in which the 
 weights vary smoothly over space and time according to a Gaussian kernel. In 
 other words, for a particular point in space-time, the weight of an input model
 is informed by the model's performance at nearby points. This approach is 
 particularly well-suited for modeling environmental factors that vary smoothly
 over space, such as temperature and air pollution, as individual models have been 
 have accuracy that varies over time and space. For example, if a model has relatively 
 high performance in New England, but not in the Mid-Atlantic region, BNE will 
 assign heigh weights to that model in New England, but not in the Mid-Atlantic.
 relatively well in New England 
 
## Identify Analysis Goals
For this vignette, we will have three goals: 
1) Generate (annual/daily) PM2.5 predictions at the ZCTA level, to be used in 
an time-series epidemiology study
2) Identify the areas with greatest predictive uncertainty as possible candidates 
for monitor placement
3) Assess whether uncertainty is unevenly distributed across areas, following 
socio-economic factors (racial composition and percent households in poverty)

The Study area is southeaast US (states) and 2010-2015 (or maybe just 1 year if daily)
